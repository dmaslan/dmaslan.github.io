            <p class="Level_2">Kids need to learn to make architecture and they’re not going to do it with Rhino. These days, they’re not going to do it with a pencil and paper either. Existing “construction set” toys, based on industrial models of mass production and modularity,
                are sorely out of sync with contemporary modes of architectural production brought on by BIM, parametric design, and digital mass customization.
                <br><br> It goes without saying that 3D modeling software and digital fabrication tools have changed the way architects produce and are slowly changing the way buildings are constructed. But these tools have also fundamentally changed
                the way we conceive of and understand three-dimensional objects and “spaces.” For better or for worse, whether or not we like to admit it, we no longer design with plans, sections, elevations, or physical models. We design with NURBs,
                meshes, number sliders, and vectors (just to name a few). We don’t draw anymore. We model, bake, Make2D, scale, unroll, export, import, and save as.
                <br><br> Working digitally does not necessitate digital fabrication tools such as 3D printers, Zünds, laser cutters, robots, or CNC mills. Rather, these tools necessitated a new way of working into which we’ve all by now been indoctrinated.
                If we can accept that this has happened, perhaps we can start to think about setting aside these machines and taking stock of what we are left with. What imprints have these techniques left on our designs and, perhaps more importantly,
                on our systems of annotation?
                <br><br> By now you may be wondering, “what does any of this have to do with kids?” I am suggesting that computer-aided design and fabrication technologies have transformed architectural labor from an activity (requiring little more than
                a pencil and paper) that was relatively accessible to curious minds of all ages into one whose demand for the skillful choreography of a multiplicity of incongruous digital environments and processes makes it impenetrable to anyone not
                already well versed in its minutiae. But if we can distill the essence of our commands, plugins, workflows, and workarounds into a kid-friendly system, maybe we can create a new system of representation that exploits or at least acknowledges
                the patterns and ways of thinking that are taken for granted in digital design. And, in the process, maybe we can make it more fun. Because play can be work too.</p>
