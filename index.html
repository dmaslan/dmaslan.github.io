                    fabrication files. But what about people who want to add an extra bedroom their apartment or an enclosure to their office desk, but don’t have access to things like plywood sheets or CNC mills? This is probably not a job for an architect,
                    but what about an architecture student? We might not quite know how to build buildings...yet...but we know how to build models. In fact, we do-it-ourselves all the time. Could we use this knowledge to produce full-scale designs for
                    public consumption? Could we use our access to digital fabrication technologies and our expertise in lightweight, easy-to-manipulate materials to produce shippable and readily-assembled building kits? Could we, in doing this, generate
                    an income for ourselves and a portfolio of “built work” while providing people with inexpensive access to architecture?</p>

                <p class="Level_3">One could argue that architects and DIY builders are on opposite ends of the design/build spectrum. Put simply, architects are experts who produce instructions for how to build something, while DIYers are nonprofessionals who take pride
                    and joy in building things themselves. The two seem to be fundamentally opposed. Architects serve entities and individuals with the financial means to pay them, while DIYers usually serve themselves, constructing small-scale spatial
                    interventions (a toolshed here, a partition wall there, a bunk bed here).<br><br> In recent years, projects like WikiHouse and OpenDesk have leveraged CAD/CAM technologies to build upon the DIY model, taking advantage of consumer software

                <p class="Level_3">Architects make models. Models are toys for architects. In other words, architects make toys. Toys that reimagine the built environment and project constructions into the future. But what if they were just toys? What if, for a moment,
                    we set aside their representational relationship to a full-scale construction and simply accepted them for what they are? I’m not proposing architects retreat into their ivory towers, purge their creations of signification and fetishize
                    their non-referential craft (hasn’t that been done before?). I’m suggesting quite the opposite. We need to make architecture more accessible to future architects. In doing this, we don’t need to convey our expertise with wall assemblies
                    or 2x4s...these standards will become obsolete with time. Rather, we need a more effective way of transferring our embodied knowledge of how two pieces of cardboard might come together or how a form might be translated from digital
                    to analog environment. And in order to do this, we need to start simple. We need to start with toys.</p>

                <p class="Level_3">Kids need to learn to make architecture and they’re not going to do it with Rhino. These days, they’re not going to do it with a pencil and paper either. Existing “construction set” toys, based on industrial models of mass production and
                    modularity, are sorely out of sync with contemporary modes of architectural production brought on by BIM, parametric design, and digital mass customization.
                    <br><br> It goes without saying that 3D modeling software and digital fabrication tools have changed the way architects produce and are slowly changing the way buildings are constructed. But these tools have also fundamentally changed
                    the way we conceive of and understand three-dimensional objects and “spaces.” For better or for worse, whether or not we like to admit it, we no longer design with plans, sections, elevations, or physical models. We design with NURBs,
                    meshes, number sliders, and vectors (just to name a few). We don’t draw anymore. We model, bake, Make2D, scale, unroll, export, import, and save as.
                    <br><br> Working digitally does not necessitate digital fabrication tools such as 3D printers, Zünds, laser cutters, robots, or CNC mills. Rather, these tools necessitated a new way of working into which we’ve all by now been indoctrinated.
                    If we can accept that this has happened, perhaps we can start to think about setting aside these machines and taking stock of what we are left with. What imprints have these techniques left on our designs and, perhaps more importantly,
                    on our systems of annotation?
                    <br><br> By now you may be wondering, “what does any of this have to do with kids?” I am suggesting that computer-aided design and fabrication technologies have transformed architectural labor from an activity (requiring little more
                    than a pencil and paper) that was relatively accessible to curious minds of all ages into one whose demand for the skillful choreography of a multiplicity of incongruous digital environments and processes makes it impenetrable to anyone
                    not already well versed in its minutiae. But if we can distill the essence of our commands, plugins, workflows, and workarounds into a kid-friendly system, maybe we can create a new system of representation that exploits or at least
                    acknowledges the patterns and ways of thinking that are taken for granted in digital design. And, in the process, maybe we can make it more fun. Because play can be work too.</p>
